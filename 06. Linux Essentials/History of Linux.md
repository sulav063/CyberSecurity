## What is Linux?

**Linux** is a free, open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. Linux powers a wide range of systems — from smartphones and servers to supercomputers and embedded devices.

## History of Linux

Linux was created by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish computer science student, in **1991**.  
He wanted a free, open-source alternative to Unix-based systems like Minix.

- He released the **first Linux kernel (version 0.01)** in September 1991.
- The project grew rapidly with global contributions.
- Linux was combined with GNU tools to form a full operating system: **GNU/Linux**.

### 1. **Origins of Unix (1969–1980s)**

- Linux traces its roots back to **Unix**, developed in **1969 at AT&T Bell Labs**.
- Unix was a powerful, portable, multiuser OS used in universities and enterprises.
- However, Unix was proprietary and expensive to license.

### 2. **Minix – A Lightweight Unix Clone (1987)**

- **Andrew Tanenbaum** developed **Minix** as a simplified, educational version of Unix.
- It was open for study but not free for modification or widespread practical use.

### 3. **Creation of Linux (1991)**

- **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish student, began working on a personal Unix-like OS kernel.
- He released the first version of **Linux kernel (0.01)** in **1991**, and made it freely available under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.

### 4. **Growth and Community Development (1992–2000s)**

- Linux combined with **GNU utilities** (developed by Richard Stallman) to form a complete OS: **GNU/Linux**.
- Developers around the world began contributing to the project.
- Distributions (distros) like **Slackware**, **Debian**, and **Red Hat** appeared.
- Linux became popular for **servers**, especially web hosting and enterprise use.

### 5. **Modern Era (2000s–Present)**

- Linux now powers:
  - The **majority of web servers** (e.g., Apache on Ubuntu, CentOS)
  - **Android OS**, which is built on the Linux kernel
  - **Supercomputers** (over 95% of the top 500 supercomputers)
  - **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud use Linux-based VMs)
  - **Embedded systems**, IoT devices, and more

## Examples of Linux Distributions (Distros)

| Distro      | Use Case / Notes                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ubuntu**  | Beginner-friendly, popular for desktops and servers    |
| **Debian**  | Stable base for many other distros                     |
| **CentOS**  | Enterprise server OS (community version of Red Hat)    |
| **Fedora**  | Cutting-edge features, sponsored by Red Hat            |
| **Kali Linux** | Penetration testing and ethical hacking              |
| **Arch Linux** | Advanced users, minimal and highly customizable     |
| **Linux Mint** | User-friendly desktop, based on Ubuntu              |
