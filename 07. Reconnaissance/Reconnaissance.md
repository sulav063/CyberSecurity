Reconnaissance is the initial phase of ethical hacking where the tester collects information about the target organization, system, or network before attempting any exploitation. The primary goal is to gather as much data as possible to understand how the target operates and identify potential weaknesses.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the target’s systems, technologies, and infrastructure.
- Gather publicly available data to minimize direct interaction.
- Identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points for later phases.
- Reduce uncertainty and plan effective attack strategies.

## What Information is Collected?

| Category            | Details Collected                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Network Information | IP addresses, subnets, domain names, DNS records          |
| System Details      | Operating systems, open ports, running services           |
| Technology Stack    | Web servers, databases, CMS, programming languages        |
| Organization Data   | Employees, email formats, job roles, office locations     |
| Security Measures   | Firewall types, IDS/IPS, SSL certificates, policies       |

## Importance of Reconnaissance

- Establishes a foundation for the penetration test.
- Helps in identifying weak points in the environment.
- Allows more targeted and efficient attacks later.
- Minimizes the risk of detection during intrusive phases.

## Overview of Recon Process

1. **Information Planning** – Define what data is needed.
2. **Data Collection** – Gather public and internal information.
3. **Analysis** – Organize and review data to find vulnerabilities.
4. **Target Profiling** – Build a structured profile of the target system.
