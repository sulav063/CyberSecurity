Ethical hacking involves understanding the various types of hackers — both malicious and non-malicious — to better defend systems and respond to threats.

### White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)
- These are **security professionals** who use their skills to **help organizations**.
- They are **legally authorized** to test systems for vulnerabilities (penetration testing, vulnerability assessments).
- Purpose: Identify and fix security issues **before malicious hackers can exploit them**.
- Work with: Organizations, governments, security firms.

### Black Hat Hackers (Malicious Hackers)
- These are **criminal hackers** who break into systems **illegally** for personal gain or to cause damage.
- They may steal data, install malware/ransomware, destroy systems, or sell information on the dark web.
- Motivation: **Financial gain**, espionage, destruction, or revenge.

### Gray Hat Hackers
- Operate in the **gray area** between white hat and black hat.
- They often find and exploit security flaws **without permission**, but **not for malicious intent**.
- They might report the flaw to the organization (sometimes asking for a reward), or disclose it publicly.
- Legal status: Often **unauthorized**, so their actions can still be **illegal**, even without bad intentions.

### Script Kiddies
- Inexperienced or unskilled individuals who use **pre-written tools or scripts** to launch attacks.
- They usually **lack deep technical knowledge**.
- Motivation: Fun, thrill, or bragging rights — not necessarily financial or political.
- Often cause **accidental damage** due to lack of understanding.

### Hacktivists
- Combine **hacking with activism**.
- Use cyberattacks to promote **political, social, or ideological causes**.
- Common methods: DDoS attacks, website defacement, data leaks.
- Example: Groups like Anonymous or individuals targeting governments or corporations for ideological reasons.

### State-Sponsored Hackers
- Work for **government agencies** or intelligence units.
- Engage in **cyber-espionage, surveillance, infrastructure attacks**, or disinformation campaigns.
- Targets: Other nations, corporations, critical infrastructure, military systems.
- Highly skilled and well-funded.
