Ethical hackers play a critical role in cybersecurity by proactively finding and fixing vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. Here’s what their daily workflow usually looks like:

### 1. Planning and Scoping Engagements  
- Collaborate with clients or internal stakeholders to understand the scope and objectives of the security assessment.  
- Define what systems, applications, or networks will be tested and under what constraints.  
- Establish rules of engagement including timing, allowed tools, and communication channels.  
- Review compliance requirements and legal boundaries to ensure ethical testing.

### 2. Running Automated and Manual Tests  
- Use automated tools like **Nmap**, **Nessus**, **Burp Suite**, or **Metasploit** to scan for vulnerabilities efficiently.  
- Perform manual testing to uncover complex vulnerabilities that tools might miss, such as business logic flaws or chained exploits.  
- Conduct social engineering tests, phishing simulations, or physical security checks if within scope.  
- Analyze results continuously and refine testing based on findings.

### 3. Communicating with Clients or Internal Teams  
- Provide regular updates during the engagement to keep stakeholders informed.  
- Clarify any unexpected findings or required changes in scope.  
- Collaborate with IT teams to validate vulnerabilities and understand system context.  
- Conduct walkthroughs or meetings to explain technical details in an understandable way.

### 4. Writing Technical Reports  
- Document all discovered vulnerabilities with clear evidence (screenshots, logs, PoCs).  
- Categorize risks by severity and potential impact.  
- Offer actionable remediation recommendations tailored to the organization’s environment.  
- Prepare both technical reports for IT/security teams and executive summaries for management.

### 5. Staying Up to Date with Latest Vulnerabilities and Tools  
- Follow security news, vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD), and research papers.  
- Participate in security communities, conferences, and training sessions.  
- Experiment with new hacking tools and techniques in controlled lab environments.  
- Continuously update certifications and skills to keep pace with evolving threats.
