**Bits and bytes** are units of digital data; a bit is the smallest unit (0 or 1), and a byte is made of 8 bits and represents one character.
***
### 1. **Bit**
- The smallest unit of data in computing.
- Can only have a value of **0** or **1**.
- Example:  
    A single switch that can be ON (1) or OFF (0).
---
### 2. **Byte**
- A group of **8 bits**.
- Usually stores **one character** (like a letter, number, or symbol).
- Example:  
    The letter **A** is represented in ASCII as the byte `01000001` (which is 65 in decimal).
---

### 3. **Data Units**
- These are units to measure data size.
- 1 Kilobyte (KB) = **1024 bytes** (not exactly 1000 due to binary system).
 **Data Unit Conversions and Their Uses**
- **1 Bit** = smallest unit of data (0 or 1)  
    _Used for:_ Representing a single binary state, e.g., on/off, true/false.
    
- **1 Byte** = 8 bits  
    _Used for:_ Storing one character (like a letter, number, or symbol).
    
- **1 Kilobyte (KB)** = 1024 Bytes  
    _Used for:_ Small text files, simple documents, or small images.
    
- **1 Megabyte (MB)** = 1024 KB = 1,048,576 Bytes  
    _Used for:_ Medium-sized files like high-quality photos, MP3 audio files, short videos.
    
- **1 Gigabyte (GB)** = 1024 MB = 1,073,741,824 Bytes  
    _Used for:_ Large files like full-length movies, software applications, or collections of photos.
    
- **1 Terabyte (TB)** = 1024 GB = 1,099,511,627,776 Bytes  
    _Used for:_ Massive storage needs like hard drives for personal computers, cloud storage for backups.
    
- **1 Petabyte (PB)** = 1024 TB  
    _Used for:_ Very large data centers, large-scale cloud storage, big data analytics.
    
- **1 Exabyte (EB)** = 1024 PB  
    _Used for:_ Extremely large data storage used by tech giants or for internet-scale data.
