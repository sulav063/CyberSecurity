### i. Offensive Approach - Proactive approach -Red Team Approach
This approach focuses on simulating real attacks to find security weaknesses before real hackers do.
1. **Penetration Testing**
	Legally hacking into systems to find vulnerabilities.
	Example: A company hires a tester to try breaking into their website and report weak points.
2.  **Teaming Red**
	A full-scope simulated attack where experts act like real hackers to test overall security.
	Example: A red team secretly tries to breach a company’s systems, physical security, and staff awareness.
3. **Malware Development**
	 Creating malware (for learning or testing) to understand how real threats work.
	Example: A tester builds a fake virus to test if antivirus software can detect it.

### ii. Defensive Approach - Reactive approach - Blue Team Approach
This approach focuses on detecting, responding to, and stopping real attacks.
1. **Security Operation Centre**
	A team that monitors and protects an organisations systems 24/7.
	Example: SOC analysts watch network logs and alert the team if a suspicious login occurs.
2. **Incident Response**
	The process of detecting and handling security breaches or attacks.
	Example: SOC analysts watch network logs and alert the team if a suspicious login occurs.
3. **Digital Forensics**
	Investigating cyber incidents by analysing digital evidence.  
	Example: After a data breach, forensics experts find out how the hacker got in and what data was stolen.
**4. Malware Analysis**
	Studying malicious software to understand how it works and how to stop it.
	Example: An analyst runs a virus in a safe lab to see what files it changes or steals.
**5. Source Code Review**
	Checking application code for security flaws before or after it's released.
	Example: Reviewing a login system’s code to make sure it doesn’t allow password bypass.
**6. Security Configuration**
	Setting up systems securely to reduce risks
	Example: Disabling unnecessary services on a server and using strong firewall rules.
