**Ethical hacking** is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, or applications for security vulnerabilities — but with permission and in a lawful, structured way. Ethical hackers, also known as **white hat hackers**, simulate cyberattacks to identify weaknesses before malicious hackers (black hats) can exploit them.

The goal is to strengthen the overall security posture of the system by discovering and fixing vulnerabilities.

## **Who is an Ethical Hacker?**

An **ethical hacker** is a cybersecurity professional who uses the same techniques and tools as malicious hackers but does so:
- With legal authorization
- For defensive purposes
- To improve system security
They may work as in-house security analysts, consultants, or be hired to perform **penetration tests** (pen tests) on a contract basis.

## **Objectives of Ethical Hacking**

1. **Identify vulnerabilities** before attackers can exploit them.
    
2. **Test security controls** to ensure they are effective.
    
3. **Simulate real-world attacks** to measure response readiness.
    
4. **Support compliance** with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).
    
5. **Improve policies** and technical configurations.
