## What is Penetration Testing?

- Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is a simulated, authorized cyberattack used to identify and exploit security weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications.
- Its purpose is to assess how well an organization can defend against real attacks and to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.
- Penetration tests are performed by ethical hackers using both manual and automated tools.

##  Domains of Penetration Testing

1. **Application Penetration Testing**
   - Focuses on finding vulnerabilities in software applications (web, mobile, desktop).
   - **Types:**
     - Web Application Testing (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
     - Mobile Application Testing (e.g., insecure storage, reverse engineering)
     - Desktop/Client-Side App Testing (e.g., DLL injection, buffer overflow)

2. **Network Penetration Testing**
   - Evaluates the security of network infrastructure and connected devices.
   - **Types:**
     - External Network Testing (from outside the organization)
     - Internal Network Testing (simulating an insider threat)
     - Wireless Network Testing (Wi-Fi security, rogue APs)

3. **API Penetration Testing**
   - Tests APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used in apps or services.
   - Checks for improper authentication, rate-limiting issues, insecure data handling, and injection flaws.

4. **Wireless Penetration Testing**
   - Focuses on wireless technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.).
   - Identifies misconfigurations, weak encryption (WEP/WPA), and rogue access points.

5. **IoT (Internet of Things) Penetration Testing**
   - Tests smart and connected devices (e.g., smart TVs, wearables, home automation).
   - Includes firmware analysis, insecure communication, and physical port testing.

6. **Cloud Penetration Testing**
   - Assesses the security of cloud platforms and services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
   - **Focus areas:**
     - Misconfigured storage (e.g., open S3 buckets)
     - Insecure IAM policies
     - API gateway flaws and exposed secrets

7. **OT (Operational Technology) / ICS / SCADA Penetration Testing**
   - Focuses on industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure.
   - **Types:**
     - ICS (Industrial Control Systems)
     - SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
     - PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) Testing
   - Checks protocol vulnerabilities, physical security gaps, and network segmentation.

8. **Automobile Penetration Testing**
   - Evaluates the cybersecurity of connected vehicles.
   - **Key areas:**
     - Infotainment systems
     - CAN bus exploitation
     - Remote keyless entry attacks
     - Firmware and telematics vulnerabilities
