| **Definition**            | A broad term for all authorized security assessments and testing activities. | A specific method that simulates real-world attacks to test system defenses. |
| **Scope**                 | Wide: includes social engineering, phishing, physical security, policy review, and more. | Narrower: focused mainly on discovering technical vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or apps. |
| **Purpose**               | To evaluate all aspects of security posture and help organizations improve defenses. | To identify and exploit vulnerabilities to assess how far an attacker could go. |
| **Approach**              | May use various tools and methods, including audits, scanning, and awareness training. | Simulates real-world attack techniques to exploit weaknesses. |
| **Authorization**         | Always done with permission (legally and ethically). | Also done with explicit permission, often under strict scope. |
| **Tools Used**            | May include pentesting tools, vulnerability scanners, training materials, audit checklists. | Uses tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, etc., to simulate attacks. |
| **Output**                | Full security assessment report with findings, risks, and recommendations. | Detailed report showing vulnerabilities exploited and potential impact. |
| **Performed By**          | Certified ethical hackers (CEH), security analysts, consultants. | Pentesters, red teams, security testers. |
| **Example Activities**    | Policy review, phishing simulations, employee awareness training, vulnerability scanning. | Network exploitation, web app testing, password cracking, privilege escalation. |
