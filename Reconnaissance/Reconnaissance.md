Reconnaissance is the initial phase in ethical hacking, focused on gathering information about a target before launching any attacks. The objective is to collect as much data as possible to understand the target’s systems, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Objectives of Reconnaissance

- Identify the target’s digital footprint and infrastructure.
- Discover public information that may help in later exploitation phases.
- Reduce uncertainty and improve the effectiveness of an attack by learning about the environment beforehand.

## Types of Reconnaissance

### 1. Passive Reconnaissance

Information is gathered *without directly interacting* with the target.  
Sources are publicly available data such as:

- Search engines
- Public records
- Social media
- Websites
- Third-party services

Passive recon is less likely to alert the target because no direct probing occurs.

### 2. Active Reconnaissance

Involves *direct interaction* with the target’s systems, which can potentially alert the target.  
Common actions include:

- Network scans
- Port scans
- Ping sweeps
- Service enumeration

Active recon is riskier but often provides more accurate and detailed information.

## WHOIS Lookup

WHOIS is a protocol used to retrieve domain registration information from publicly available databases. It helps identify:

- The domain owner (individual or organization)
- Registrar information
- Domain creation and expiry dates
- Contact information (administrative, technical)
- Name servers associated with the domain

Information obtained from WHOIS can be used to:

- Map the ownership structure of a target network
- Identify possible human targets (administrators, technical contacts)
- Find related domains registered by the same organization
- Trace infrastructure used by the target over time
