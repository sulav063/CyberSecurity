# Data
- Data is raw, unprocessed facts or figures without context.
- It can be in the form of numbers, text, symbols, images, or sounds.
- Data by itself has no meaning until it is interpreted or processed.

# Information
- Information is data that has been processed, organized, and given context.
- It is meaningful and useful for decision-making or analysis.
- Example: Raw scores (data) → average score (information).

# Data vs Information

| Aspect       | Data                                | Information                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Meaning      | Raw and unprocessed                 | Processed and meaningful               |
| Context      | No context                          | Has context                            |
| Form         | Numbers, symbols, facts             | Organized and structured               |
| Example      | `92, 85, 78`                        | "Average score is 85"                  |
| Usage        | Input for processing                | Output for analysis and decisions      |

# Data Computing / Communications
- **Data computing** involves processing and analyzing data using computing systems.
- **Data communications** refers to transmitting data between devices using a transmission medium (wired or wireless).
- It enables networking and the exchange of information between systems.

# Data Communications Components
1. **Message** – The actual data or information to be communicated.
2. **Sender** – The device or person who sends the message.
3. **Receiver** – The device or person who receives the message.
4. **Medium** – The physical path through which the message travels (e.g., cable, radio waves).
5. **Protocol** – A set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received.
6. **Encoder/Decoder** – Converts data to signals and vice versa.

# Message and Its Types
- A **message** is a unit of data sent from sender to receiver.
- **Types of Messages**:
  - **Simplex** – One-way communication (e.g., keyboard to computer).
  - **Half-Duplex** – Two-way communication, but only one direction at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
  - **Full-Duplex** – Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., phone call).

# Transmission Media and Its Types
- **Transmission media** is the channel used to transmit data from one point to another.

## Guided Media (Wired)
- Data travels through physical cables.
- Examples:
  - Twisted Pair Cable (used in LANs)
  - Coaxial Cable (used in cable TV)
  - Optical Fiber (high-speed, long-distance)

## Unguided Media (Wireless)
- Data is transmitted through air using electromagnetic waves.
- Examples:
  - Radio Waves (Wi-Fi)
  - Microwaves (satellite links)
  - Infrared (remote controls)

# Brief History of Networking
- Networking began with **basic point-to-point connections** between two computers.
- In the **1960s**, the U.S. Department of Defense developed **ARPANET**, the first packet-switching network, which laid the foundation for the modern Internet.
- ARPANET allowed multiple computers to communicate over long distances, evolving into today’s global Internet.
- Early networks were **circuit-switched** (like telephone lines), but later shifted to **packet-switched** systems which are more efficient and scalable.
- The development of **TCP/IP protocols**, **Ethernet**, and **networking standards** in the 1970s–1990s rapidly advanced modern networking.
- Today, networks support **cloud computing**, **cybersecurity**, **IoT**, and global communication.
