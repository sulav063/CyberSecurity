# Data
- Data is raw, unprocessed facts or figures without context.
- It can be in the form of numbers, text, symbols, images, or sounds.
- Data by itself has no meaning until it is interpreted or processed.
***
# Information
- Information is data that has been processed, organized, and given context.
- It is meaningful and useful for decision-making or analysis.
- Example: Raw scores (data) → average score (information).

# Data vs Information

| Aspect       | Data                                | Information                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Meaning      | Raw and unprocessed                 | Processed and meaningful               |
| Context      | No context                          | Has context                            |
| Form         | Numbers, symbols, facts             | Organized and structured               |
| Example      | `92, 85, 78`                        | "Average score is 85"                  |
| Usage        | Input for processing                | Output for analysis and decisions      |

# Data Computing / Communications
- **Data computing** involves processing and analyzing data using computing systems.
- **Data communications** refers to transmitting data between devices using a transmission medium (wired or wireless).
- It enables networking and the exchange of information between systems.
***
# Data Communications Components
1. **Message** – The actual data or information to be communicated.
2. **Sender** – The device or person who sends the message.
3. **Receiver** – The device or person who receives the message.
4. **Medium** – The physical path through which the message travels (e.g., cable, radio waves).
5. **Protocol** – A set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received.
6. **Encoder/Decoder** – Converts data to signals and vice versa.
***
# Message and Its Types
- A **message** is a unit of data sent from sender to receiver.
- **Types of Messages**:
  - **Simplex** – One-way communication (e.g., keyboard to computer).
  - **Half-Duplex** – Two-way communication, but only one direction at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
  - **Full-Duplex** – Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., phone call).
***
# Transmission Media and Its Types
- **Transmission media** is the channel used to transmit data from one point to another.

## Guided Media (Wired)
- Data travels through physical cables.
- Examples:
  - Twisted Pair Cable (used in LANs)
  - Coaxial Cable (used in cable TV)
  - Optical Fiber (high-speed, long-distance)

## Unguided Media (Wireless)
- Data is transmitted through air using electromagnetic waves.
- Examples:
  - Radio Waves (Wi-Fi)
  - Microwaves (satellite links)
  - Infrared (remote controls)

# Brief History of Networking
- Networking began with **basic point-to-point connections** between two computers.
- In the **1960s**, the U.S. Department of Defense developed **ARPANET**, the first packet-switching network, which laid the foundation for the modern Internet.
- ARPANET allowed multiple computers to communicate over long distances, evolving into today’s global Internet.
- Early networks were **circuit-switched** (like telephone lines), but later shifted to **packet-switched** systems which are more efficient and scalable.
- The development of **TCP/IP protocols**, **Ethernet**, and **networking standards** in the 1970s–1990s rapidly advanced modern networking.
- Today, networks support **cloud computing**, **cybersecurity**, **IoT**, and global communication.

# What is Networking?

- **Networking** is the process of connecting two or more computing devices (such as computers, servers, printers, or mobile phones) to share data and resources.

## Purpose of Networking
- Share files, software, and hardware (e.g., printers)
- Enable communication (email, messaging, video calls)
- Access the internet and cloud services
- Centralize data and security management

## Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small, local networks (home, office)
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or campus
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet)

## Components of a Network
- **Devices:** Computers, routers, switches, servers, etc.
- **Transmission Media:** Cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals
- **Protocols:** Rules that define how data is transmitted (e.g., TCP/IP)
- **Network Interfaces:** Hardware or software that connects a device to a network (e.g., NIC)

## Benefits of Networking
- Efficient communication and collaboration
- Resource and cost sharing
- Centralized control and data backup
- Scalability and remote access

# Physical Topology

- **Physical topology** refers to the **actual physical layout** of devices (nodes) and cables in a computer network.
- It shows **how devices are physically connected**, not how data flows (which is called logical topology).
- The choice of topology affects performance, cost, and scalability of a network.

## Common Types of Physical Topologies

### 1. **Bus Topology**
- All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
- Data travels in both directions and is received by all devices.
- **Pros:** Easy to install, low cost.
- **Cons:** Difficult to troubleshoot, performance degrades with more devices.

### 2. **Star Topology**
- All devices are connected to a central device (like a switch or hub).
- Data goes through the central point before reaching its destination.
- **Pros:** Easy to manage, isolate problems.
- **Cons:** Central device failure affects the whole network.

### 3. **Ring Topology**
- Devices are connected in a closed loop; each device connects to two others.
- Data travels in one direction (or both in dual ring).
- **Pros:** Predictable performance.
- **Cons:** Failure of one device can disrupt the network.

### 4. **Mesh Topology**
- Every device is connected to every other device.
- Provides multiple paths for data to travel.
- **Pros:** High reliability and redundancy.
- **Cons:** Expensive and complex to install.

### 5. **Tree Topology**
- A hybrid of star and bus topologies.
- Multiple star networks are connected to a central bus.
- **Pros:** Scalable and hierarchical formula 
- **Cons:** Depends heavily on the root or backbone line.

### 6. **Hybrid Topology**
- Combines two or more different topologies (e.g., star-ring, star-bus).
- **Pros:** Flexible and scalable.
- **Cons:** Complex design and management.
