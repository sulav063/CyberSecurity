A computer is made up of hardware components that work together to perform data processing, storage, and communication tasks.
**1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- Executes instructions and processes data.
- Called the **“brain”** of the computer.
- Performs arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations.
**2. RAM (Random Access Memory)**
- Temporary memory used to hold data and programs currently in use.
- Volatile memory — data is lost when power is off.
- Faster than storage devices.
**3. Hard Drive / SSD (Storage)**
- **Hard Drive (HDD):** Uses spinning disks to store data permanently.
- **Solid State Drive (SSD):** Faster, uses flash memory with no moving parts.
- Stores operating system, applications, and files long-term.
**4. Motherboard**
- The main circuit board that connects all components.
- Provides communication pathways between CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.
**5. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
- Handles rendering of images, videos, and animations.
- Useful for parallel processing tasks like gaming, video editing, and password cracking.
**6. PSU (Power Supply Unit)**
- Converts electrical power from the outlet into usable power for computer components.
- Provides **regulated** power at different voltages.
**7. I/O Devices (Input/Output)**
- Devices for user interaction: keyboard, mouse, monitor, printers, scanners, speakers.

### Additional Components and Processors
**8. Cache Memory**
- Small, very fast memory located inside or near the CPU.
- Stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing.
- Levels: L1 (smallest & fastest), L2, L3 (larger but slower).
**9. Chipset**
- Part of the motherboard that manages data flow between CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- Often includes Northbridge (memory controller) and Southbridge (I/O controller).
 **10. Co-Processor**
- Auxiliary processor used to handle specific tasks, like math calculations or graphics.
- Example: Floating Point Unit (FPU) for complex math operations.
 **11. Network Interface Card (NIC)**
- Hardware that connects a computer to a network.
- Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
#### 12. **Sound Card**
- Processes audio input/output.
- Converts digital audio data to analog signals and vice versa.
**13. Cooling Systems**
- Keep processors and components from overheating.
- Includes fans, heat sinks, liquid cooling systems.
**14. BIOS / UEFI**
- Firmware stored on a chip on the motherboard.
- Initializes hardware during boot-up and provides low-level control.

### Specialized Processors
 **15. Multi-core Processor**
- CPU with multiple processing units (cores) to perform parallel processing.
- Improves multitasking and performance.
**16. ARM Processor**
- A type of CPU architecture common in smartphones and embedded devices.
- Known for power efficiency.
**17. TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)**
- Specialized processor designed by Google for machine learning and AI tasks.
