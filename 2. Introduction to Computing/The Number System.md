A number system defines a method for representing numbers using symbols; common types include **binary (base-2)**, **decimal (base-10)**, **octal (base-8)**, and **hexadecimal (base-16)**.
- **Binary Number System:**  A system that uses only 0s and 1s to represent data in computers.
***
- **Decimal Number System:** A base-10 system commonly used by humans, using digits 0–9.
***
- **Hexadecimal System:** A base-16 system (0–9 and A–F) often used in memory addressing and color codes.
***
- **Octal System:** A base-8 number system using digits 0–7, occasionally used in file permissions in Unix.
***
- **Conversion Between Systems:** The process of converting numbers from one base to another, such as binary to decimal.

**** What is ASCII?****
**ASCII** stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**.  
It is a character encoding system that represents text using numbers so computers can store and process it.
**Purpose of ASCII**
- Converts characters (letters, digits, symbols) into binary codes.
- Each ASCII character is represented using **7 bits**, allowing **128 unique characters** (0–127).
**Structure of ASCII**
- **0 to 31** → Control characters (e.g., newline, tab, backspace).
- **32 to 126** → Printable characters:
    - 32 = Space
    - 48 to 57 = Numbers '0' to '9'
    - 65 to 90 = Uppercase 'A' to 'Z'
    - 97 to 122 = Lowercase 'a' to 'z'
    - **127** → DEL (delete character)
