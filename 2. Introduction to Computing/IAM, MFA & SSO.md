**IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a system of policies, technologies, and processes used to manage digital identities and control how users and devices access resources.
- IAM includes creating and managing user accounts, defining roles and permissions, enforcing security policies, and tracking user activities.
- Good IAM practices help protect sensitive data by making sure only authorized users can access specific systems or information.
- IAM solutions often include features like single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, and auditing.
- Examples of IAM tools and services include Azure Active Directory, AWS IAM, and Okta.

**Authentication**
- Verifying who the user is.  
- **Key questions:**  
  - Who are you?  
  - How do you prove your identity?  
  - Are your credentials valid?  
- Example: Username + password, biometric scan, OTP.


***Authorization***
- Defining what the authenticated user is allowed to do.  
- **Key questions:**  
  - What resources can you access?  
  - What actions are you permitted to perform?  
- Example: Read, write, or delete permissions on files.

**Accounting (or Audit)**
- Tracking what the user did.  
- **Key questions:**  
  - What actions did you perform?  
  - When did you perform them?  
  - Were your actions compliant with policies?  
- Example: Logging user activities and keeping audit trails for security and compliance.

**Administration**
- Managing and maintaining user identities, permissions, and policies throughout their lifecycle.  
- **Key questions:**  
  - How are user identities and permissions managed?  
  - Who can create, modify, or revoke access?  
  - How is access provisioned and de-provisioned over time?  
- Example: Creating accounts, modifying roles, revoking access when an employee leaves.

 **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more independent forms of evidence (factors) to verify their identity.
- Factors are usually categorized as:
  - **Something you know** (e.g., password or PIN)
  - **Something you have** (e.g., smartphone, hardware token, smart card)
  - **Something you are** (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition, retina scan)
- MFA greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is stolen, because the attacker would still need the other factor(s).
- MFA is commonly used for securing online accounts, VPN access, and sensitive corporate systems.
- Examples of MFA tools include Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and hardware tokens like YubiKey.

**2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is the most commonly used type of MFA.
- It specifically requires **exactly two factors**, usually:
  - A password or PIN (**something you know**)
  - Plus a one-time code sent to your phone, an authenticator app, or a hardware token (**something you have**)
- 2FA strikes a balance between improved security and user convenience.
- Common examples: logging into a bank account with a password plus an OTP (One-Time Password) sent by SMS or generated by an app like Google Authenticator.

**SSO (Single Sign-On)**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication method that allows a user to log in once with a single set of credentials and then access multiple applications or systems without needing to log in again for each one.
- SSO works by using a centralized identity provider (IdP) that handles authentication and issues trusted tokens to connected services.
- This reduces password fatigue for users and lowers the risk of weak or reused passwords.
- SSO also helps organizations manage user access more efficiently and can be integrated with IAM and MFA for stronger security.
- Examples of SSO implementations include Google SSO, Microsoft SSO (Azure AD), and enterprise tools like Okta and OneLogin.
