Server-side languages are programming languages that run on the **web server**, not on the user’s browser. They are used to handle the backend of a website or application. Unlike client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), which runs on the user’s device, server-side code runs on a server and sends the result to the client.

**They are required for:**
1. Storing and retrieving data:
    
    - Using databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to save user information, posts, or transactions.
        
2. **Creating dynamic pages:**
    
    - Pages that change depending on the user or situation (e.g., showing a personalized dashboard).
        
3. **Managing accounts and authentication:**
    
    - Logging in/out, password handling, sessions, and user roles.
        
4. **Running backend logic:**
    
    - Performing calculations, sending emails, generating reports, or processing payments.
        
5. **Communication with APIs:**
    
    - Fetching external data (e.g., weather, payment gateway) securely.
