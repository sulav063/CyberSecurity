Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that automates the exploitation process. It provides an extensive library of exploits, payloads, and post-exploitation modules. Security testers use Metasploit to test vulnerabilities in a safe and controlled manner. Its modular design allows users to combine different exploits with different payloads, giving flexibility in attack scenarios. Metasploit also includes auxiliary modules for scanning, fuzzing, and brute-forcing, making it a complete toolkit for offensive security.

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Start Metasploit
msfconsole

# Search for exploit
search vsftpd 2.3.4

# Select exploit

# Set target IP
