Exploitation is the stage in penetration testing where vulnerabilities are actively used to compromise a target system. It follows vulnerability discovery and is often the most critical part of an assessment because it demonstrates real-world risk. Exploitation typically involves running malicious code (exploit) against a weakness in the target software or service. Once successful, it provides access, privilege escalation, or control of the victim system. Ethical hackers use exploitation responsibly to show impact, while attackers use it maliciously for data theft or system control.
